The WeCrowd API is an API written in Ruby on Rails for the existing wecrowd-rails repository, which contains the source code for the WeCrowd website. The API currently has endpoints for viewing all campaigns, viewing a specific campaign, donating to a specific campaign, a WeCrowd user logging in, and a WeCrowd user viewing his/her respective campaigns upon logging in. The API was created for the purpose of a client being able to easily interact with the WeCrowd server. A specific case of this interaction will be in the mobile demo of WeCrowd (currently in progress).
